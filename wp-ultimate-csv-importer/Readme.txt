= How to Import WordPress Site from Localhost? =

If you've developed your site locally using XAMPP or WAMP, you can easily export it for deployment on a remote host. Here's how:

1. Use the export tab within the plugin after finalizing development and customization.
2. Leverage advanced filters to exclude unwanted content and ensure a clean import on your remote server.

This method is also helpful for:

* Building new sites locally and migrating existing content from an old server.
* Restoring your site after migrating it to a new server.

= How to Validate a CSV File for WordPress Import? =

Missing or misplaced characters can cause import failures. It's crucial to validate your CSV file before importing it into WordPress. You can use a free tool like "CSV Lint" to identify any errors and their locations for correction.

= How to Import XML in WordPress? =

To import **XML** files into WordPress, you can use the WP Import Export plugin's XML import feature. Simply upload your **XML file** through the plugin's interface, and it will map the fields to corresponding WordPress content types, including **posts**, **pages**, **custom fields**, and more. The plugin ensures your data is imported without altering your existing site structure, keeping everything organized and intact.


= Can I Get Sample Files for Testing the Import? =

Yes! Download free sample CSV files specifically designed for testing the import functionality with the Ultimate CSV Importer plugin: [Link to Sample CSV Files](https://www.smackcoders.com/blog/wordpress-ultimate-csv-importer-csv-sample-files-and-updates.html?utmsource=web&utmcampaign=readme&utmmedium=wporg)

= WordPress Posts Not Showing After Import - Why and How to Fix? =

There are two main reasons why your posts might not be showing after import:

1. **Missing Mandatory Fields:** Ensure all required fields in your import file have values assigned.
2. **wpdebug Setting:** If the `wpdebug` value in your wp-config.php file is set to `True`, it might interfere with the import process. Set it to `False` before importing.


= How to import posts with images? =

To import posts with images, use the **Automatic Media Handling** feature in the WP Import Export plugin. This feature automatically detects, imports, and links images from your CSV or XML files directly to your posts or products. Images are added to your WordPress media library without needing to upload them manually. Additionally, it enhances image **SEO** by automatically adding alt text and titles. This makes managing and displaying images easy, even for large imports.


= Why does My Images Import to the Media Library fail?

Here are some reasons why images might not be imported:

1. **Unsupported Formats:** The plugin may not support the image format you're trying to import.
2. **Permission Issues:** The image URL might require public access for download.
3. **Domain or URL Issues:** The image URL may be invalid or not secured (HTTPS).


= How to Import All Images from External URLs? =

In the plugin's "Manage Media Uploads" section, enable the option **"Download Post-Content External Images to Media"**. This allows you to import images directly from various online sources (e.g., Google Images, Pexels, Dropbox) to your WordPress media library. [Refer to the plugin's documentation for more details](https://www.smackcoders.com/documentation/wp-ultimate-csv-importer-pro/import-images-into-wordpress?utmsource=web&utmcampaign=readme&utmmedium=wporg)

Additionally, you can import **user passwords**, **user roles**, and other custom metadata for a smooth import process.


= How to Import Export Custom Post Types in WordPress? =

With the WP Import Export plugin, you can import and export **custom post types** (like products, events, portfolios, etc.) in WordPress.

This makes managing different post types, along with their categories, tags, and taxonomies, quick and easy.
